# Blobripper
Here you are witnessing the birth of a video game testing your reactivity and precision. How long do you think you can dodge?

# Current state of the project:
Gameplay already okay. Mods all okay and functional. Online leaderboard not functional at all yet. Pause menu 99% functinoal (but no clickable button yet) with an unknown bug that occurs when pausing out in progressive mode and survival mode, lack of music. Some sound effects already added but the game needs more. No main menu yet.
